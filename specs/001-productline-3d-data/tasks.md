# Tasks: Productline 3D Data Retrieval

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-productline-3d-data/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: Tests are included as they are explicitly requested in the Constitution (Test-First principle)

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: Flask application with integrated testing interface
- Paths follow the structure defined in plan.md

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [x] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan in src/
- [x] T002 Initialize Python project with Flask dependencies in requirements.txt
- [x] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools (black, flake8, pytest)
- [x] T004 [P] Create configuration files in config/ directory
- [x] T005 [P] Setup logging configuration in src/logging.py
- [x] T006 [P] Create Docker configuration in docker-compose.yml
- [x] T007 [P] Setup environment configuration management in config/

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

- [x] T008 Setup database schema and migrations framework in src/models/
- [x] T009 [P] Implement database connection and pooling in src/database.py
- [x] T010 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure in src/api/
- [x] T011 [P] Create base models/entities that all stories depend on in src/models/
- [x] T012 [P] Configure error handling and logging infrastructure in src/middleware/
- [x] T013 [P] Setup environment configuration management in config/
- [x] T014 [P] Implement CORS middleware for Unreal Engine integration in src/middleware/cors.py
- [x] T015 [P] Create initialization scripts in src/scripts/
- [x] T016 [P] Setup health check endpoints in src/api/health.py
- [x] T017 [P] Configure database indexes for performance in src/models/indexes.py

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - Retrieve Object Data by ID (Priority: P1) üéØ MVP

**Goal**: Unreal Engine application can retrieve complete 3D visualization data for a specific productline element using its object ID

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a GET request with object ID and verifying complete 3D data response including coordinates, status, and metadata

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 ‚Üí P2 ‚Üí P3 ‚Üí P4)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 models but independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1/US2 but independently testable
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - Depends on US1 but independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Contract test for GET /api/v1/objects/{id} in tests/contract/test_object_retrieval.py"
Task: "Integration test for object retrieval in tests/integration/test_object_endpoints.py"
Task: "Unit test for ProductlineObject model in tests/unit/test_productline_object.py"
Task: "Unit test for 3DCoordinates model in tests/unit/test_coordinates.py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create ProductlineObject model in src/models/productline_object.py"
Task: "Create 3DCoordinates model in src/models/coordinates.py"
```

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational ‚Üí Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
5. Add User Story 4 ‚Üí Test independently ‚Üí Deploy/Demo
6. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
   - Developer D: User Story 4
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence
