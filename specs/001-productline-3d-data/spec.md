# Feature Specification: Productline 3D Data Retrieval

**Feature Branch**: `001-productline-3d-data`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I want this Backend to provide data for elements in a productline to the unreal engine application. the data include the 3d coords, including the position, height, direction, etc. and the status of the given object. The frontend might send a simple object id and ask 'hey, give everything you know about the object and i can visualize it correctly in the 3d world.' the visulization process might include a timeline, so the backend should be able to check the object status acoording to a timestamp."

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-01-27

- Q: Should we include a testing interface for developers to manually test API responses? â†’ A: Yes, add developer testing interface with manual object ID input and JSON response display for comparison with Unreal Engine application

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Retrieve Object Data by ID (Priority: P1)

Unreal Engine application requests complete 3D visualization data for a specific productline element using its object ID.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality that enables 3D visualization - without this, the system cannot serve its primary purpose.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a GET request with object ID and verifying complete 3D data response including coordinates, status, and metadata.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a valid object ID exists in the system, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data, **Then** system returns complete 3D coordinates, status, and metadata
2. **Given** an invalid object ID is provided, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data, **Then** system returns appropriate error message with 404 status
3. **Given** object exists but has no 3D data, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data, **Then** system returns object with default/empty 3D coordinates

---

### User Story 2 - Retrieve Object Data by Timestamp (Priority: P2)

Unreal Engine application requests object data for a specific point in time to support timeline-based visualization.

**Why this priority**: Timeline functionality is essential for historical visualization and process tracking, but depends on basic object retrieval working first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a GET request with object ID and timestamp, verifying historical 3D data response matches the specified time period.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** object has historical data at specified timestamp, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data with timestamp, **Then** system returns 3D data as it existed at that time
2. **Given** timestamp is before object creation, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data with timestamp, **Then** system returns appropriate error or empty state
3. **Given** timestamp is in the future, **When** Unreal Engine requests object data with timestamp, **Then** system returns current data with appropriate warning

---

### User Story 3 - Batch Object Data Retrieval (Priority: P3)

Unreal Engine application requests data for multiple objects simultaneously to optimize performance.

**Why this priority**: Performance optimization for complex scenes with multiple objects, but requires individual object retrieval to work first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by sending a POST request with multiple object IDs and verifying batch response with all requested objects' data.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** multiple valid object IDs, **When** Unreal Engine requests batch object data, **Then** system returns array of complete 3D data for all objects
2. **Given** mix of valid and invalid object IDs, **When** Unreal Engine requests batch object data, **Then** system returns data for valid objects and errors for invalid ones
3. **Given** large number of object IDs (100+), **When** Unreal Engine requests batch object data, **Then** system handles request efficiently without timeout

---

### User Story 4 - Developer Testing Interface (Priority: P4)

Unreal Engine developer uses a simple web testing page to manually enter object IDs and verify API responses, then compares results with Unreal Engine application to identify any data misalignment.

**Why this priority**: Essential for development and debugging workflow, but depends on core API functionality being implemented first.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by accessing the testing page, entering object IDs, and verifying displayed JSON responses match expected format and content.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** developer accesses the testing page, **When** they enter a valid object ID, **Then** page displays complete JSON response with 3D coordinates, status, and metadata
2. **Given** developer enters an invalid object ID, **When** they submit the form, **Then** page displays appropriate error message and HTTP status code
3. **Given** developer receives API response, **When** they compare data with Unreal Engine application, **Then** they can identify any data format or content misalignments
4. **Given** developer tests timestamp functionality, **When** they enter object ID and timestamp, **Then** page displays historical data response for verification

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when object ID format is invalid (non-numeric, too long, special characters)?
- How does system handle concurrent requests for the same object?
- What happens when database is temporarily unavailable?
- How does system handle objects with missing 3D coordinate data?
- What happens when timestamp format is invalid or out of range?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-003**: System MUST return object status and metadata along with 3D data
- **FR-004**: System MUST support timestamp-based historical data retrieval
- **FR-005**: System MUST return JSON format responses compatible with Unreal Engine
- **FR-006**: System MUST handle batch requests for multiple objects
- **FR-007**: System MUST return appropriate HTTP status codes (200, 404, 400, 500)
- **FR-008**: System MUST validate object ID format before processing
- **FR-009**: System MUST handle missing or incomplete 3D data gracefully
- **FR-010**: System MUST support CORS headers for Unreal Engine cross-origin requests
- **FR-011**: System MUST provide a simple web testing interface for developers
- **FR-012**: Testing interface MUST allow manual object ID input and display JSON responses
- **FR-013**: Testing interface MUST support timestamp input for historical data testing

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **ProductlineObject**: Represents a single element in the productline with unique ID, 3D coordinates (x, y, z, height, direction), status, and metadata
- **ObjectHistory**: Represents historical state of an object at specific timestamps, linked to ProductlineObject
- **3DCoordinates**: Represents spatial data including position (x, y, z), height, and direction/rotation
- **ObjectStatus**: Represents current state of object (active, inactive, processing, error, etc.)
